# Introduction 

This is a short demonstration of reproducible research conducted in openSAFELY. 

# Results
## Age of the cohort 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library('tidyverse')

d <- read_csv(
  "../output/input.csv.gz",
  col_types = cols(patient_id = col_integer(), age = col_double(), died_any = col_integer())
)

# Age plot 
plot_age <- ggplot(data=d, aes(d$age)) + geom_histogram()
plot_age
```

## Deaths in the cohort 

There are `r d$died_any %>% sum()` deaths in this dataset.
